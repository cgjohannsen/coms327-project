Assignment 1.10

** New in 1.10 **

LIGHT objects now function. They increase the visual range of the PC by the attribute value in the description.

Ranged combat has been implemented. 'r' is the command which will bring the user to the ranged combat screen, if a ranged weapon is equipped, and 'a' will attack the target location. 
All ranged weapons have a blast radius determined by the attribute value of the description. 
For the example bow object in the object_desc.txt file, the radius is 0, therefore there is no splash damage. 
The crappy hand grenade on the other hand (a green '}') has a value of 1. 
This blast radius is displayed to the user in the ranged attack view. 
Damage done to monsters farther away from the target is lessened as well by a factor of their distance from the target times 5. 
Note the PC is not free from splash damage, so be careful. 

*****************

This program can generate, load, and save dungeons in accordance to the specifications for assignments up to 1.03. It can also calculate distances from the player to ech cell in the dungeon. These distances are based on including walls or not, and if including walls the hardness of each wall cell.

The executable, when given an argument for the switch nummon, generate a dungeon with the argument number of monsters. When executed, the program will wait for user input and move the PC according to the spec provided. (Similar to vim navigation commands)

The PC can navigate the dungeon, go up or down stairs to new, random dungeons, slay monsters, and be slain themselves. The user can press 'm' to open a view of all monsters and their locations relative to the PC.

We also now have objects in the game. Here is a table showing the various types which are elegible to show:

| Type       | Symbol |
| ---        | ---    |
| WEAPON     | &#124; |
| OFFHAND    | )      |
| RANGED     | }      |
| ARMOR      | [      |
| HELMET     | ]      |
| CLOAK      | (      |
| GLOVES     |  {     |
| BOOTS      | \      |
| RING       |  =     |
| AMULET     | "      |
| LIGHT      | _      |
| SCROLL     | ~      |
| BOOK       | ?      |
| FLASK      | !      |

Now with debugging commands, our adventurer can now view the entire dungeon when the 'f' key is pressed, or teleport anywhere in dungeon with the 'g' key.

Updated combat and object functionality. One can now pick up items by walking over them, view their inventory and equipment, inspect an item, and equip or unequip items through keyboard commands.
